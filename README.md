Simple Score Counter App for two players. 
First time working with the CSS framework "Bulma". 
Players can decide up to what score (between 3-10) they want to play. 
Each player is assigned a button, via which they can add to their score until the winning score is reached. 

Many thanks to Colt Steele for being an amazing teacher :)
